# Doc-Film-Vb.net
DocFIlm is an application that I created in visual basic, it is a kind of store to buy films, there is a user side and an admin side

The user side allows profile modification by changing its identifiers and adding balance.
you can also have access to a film catalog, a search...
we can buy a thread with our balance and resell it if we wish from the application

the admin side.
Before starting the admin password is 545 (but don't tell anyone, ok).
the admin party allows you to delete a film, modify it and add it with photos of course, it also allows you to ban a user from seeing the most purchased film or the most sold one.

The database is in access, and for the image system, the images are automatically stored in an image folder with the same name as the film, which allows you to see it in the page of each film for the second image. its name is the film id + 0.1.
I hope you will like this project, I will do it again soon in a web application version
